**ggdmcHeaders** provides the C++ backend for choice response time models, enabling high-performance computation for hierarchical modelling and Bayesian inference.  
It integrates with the Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) sampler from the [`ggdmc`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggdmc) package, allowing users to build and fit design-based cognitive models, including factorial designs.

This package serves as a shared C++ codebase for the following packages:  
[`ggdmcModel`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggdmcModel),  
[`ggdmcPrior`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggdmcPrior),  
[`ggdmcLikelihood`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggdmcLikelihood),  
[`lbaModel`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lbaModel),  
[`ddModel`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ddModel), and  
[`ggdmc`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggdmc).
