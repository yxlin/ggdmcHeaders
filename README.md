# ggdmcHeaders

The package is a collection of the 'C++' implementation of the choice
response time model. It connects the model to the Differential
Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) sampler implemented in
the _ggdmc_ package.

The package supports the hierarchical modelling, Bayesian inference,
choice response time models and factorial designs, allowing users to
build their own design-based models.

The package serves as the C++ backends for the following packages:
ggdmcModel, ggdmcPrior, ggdmcLikelihood, lbaModel, ddModel and ggdmc.
