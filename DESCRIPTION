Description: A fast 'C++' implementation of the design-based, Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) and the Linear Ballistic Accumulation (LBA) model. It enables the user to optimise the choice response time model by connecting with the Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) sampler implemented in the 'ggdmc' package. The package fuses the hierarchical modelling, Bayesian inference, choice response time models and factorial designs, allowing users to build their own design-based models. For more information on the underlying models, see the works by Voss, Rothermund, and Voss (2004) <doi:10.3758/BF03196893>, Ratcliff and McKoon (2008) <doi:10.1162/neco.2008.12-06-420>, and Brown and Heathcote (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002>.
